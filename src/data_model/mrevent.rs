///  Once the offer cut off time has passed and as the schedule changes AEMO is obliged to accept MR capacity to meet the schedule in merit order according to the offers submitted. The relationship to a specific schedule, the merit order of submitted offers and accepted quantities for each trading interval are stored in MR_Event_Schedule, MR_DayOffer_Stack and MR_PerOffer_Stack. MR_PEROFFER_STACK reports the accepted MR capacity (Accepted_Capacity) required from each unit for each trading interval. MR_PEROFFER_STACK is sparse so lists only units with accepted capacity &gt; 0 for that trading interval.  The Deducted_Capacity field allows the tracking and implementation of participant requested reductions to accepted MR capacity to be tracked and applied. MR_PEROFFER_STACK is reported confidentially to each participant to notify acceptance of an MR offer. Source MR_PEROFFER_STACK updates are ad hoc. Volume 4800 rows per year
