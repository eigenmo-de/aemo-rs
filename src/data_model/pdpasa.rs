/// # Description
///  PDPASA_REGIONSOLUTION is public so is available to all participants. Source PDPASA_REGIONSOLUTION is updated each PDPASA run (i.e. half-hourly). Volume Rows per day: 32000 Notes LRC Determination SURPLUSRESERVE is the surplus reserve in a region based on meeting the demand plus the reserve requirement in all regions simultaneously. Note that any surplus above the network restrictions and system reserve requirements is reported in the region it is generated, thus a surplus of zero can mean that a region is importing to meet a requirement or that it has exported all surplus to meet an adjacent regionâ€™s requirement. &nbsp; The PASA processes also calculate a regionally optimised surplus called the Maximum LRC Surplus (MAXSURPLUSRESERVE) being a figure on how much generation could be brought to this region subject to meeting requirements in other regions. &nbsp; LOR Determination MAXSPARECAPACITY is a regionally optimised figure representing the surplus generation able to be brought to a region subject to meeting the demand in all other regions. &nbsp; Participants are directed to the first half hour of the Predispatch PASA (PDPASA) reports as NEMMCO's latest reserve determination for a given half hour.
